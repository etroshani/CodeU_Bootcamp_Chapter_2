##     1) First Exercise Of The Day - Guess The Number!      ##

import random       #The 'random' module allows to generate values randomly.

x = random.randrange(1,10)      # 'randrange' allows us to generate between a range of 2 values -> randrange(value1, value2)

number = int(input("Choose a number between 1 and 10: "))

while number != x:
    print("\nSorry, you guessed incorrectly! Try again.")
    number = int(input("Guess a number between 1 and 10: "))

print("Congratulations! You guessed correctly!")



##    2) Metaverse Guessing Contest!    ##
import random


tries = 3
number = random.randrange(1,10)    
    
call = input("\nWrite 'call' to call the Radio Station: ")
    
if call == "call":
    print("Thank you for calling Radio Metaverse! Welcome to the Metaverse contest!")
        
    while tries > 0:
        guess = int(input("\nPlease enter your guess: "))
        
        if guess == number:
            print("\nCongratulations!! You now have access to the METAVERSE :)")
        
        else:
            print("Sorry, you guessed incorrectly!")
            tries -= 1

else:
    print("Not a valid answer!")


####    HOMEWORK: Defeat the Final Boss!    ####

#   You must build a game where a user must face a final boss. In this dual, the player must guess the boss's number to attack!

#   Here are the requirements:
#   1) The final boss has a total of 5 lives (create a variable). This means the WHILE loop stops when his lives reach 0.
#   2) The final boss's number is generated randomly between 1 and 10.
#   3) After each user guess (done with input), the boss's number changes. 
#       HINT: This means that the random.randrange has to be repeated after each guess.
#   4) Your attack takes a life off of the boss.
#   5) Print 'You have defeated the boss!' when you have defeated the boss.
