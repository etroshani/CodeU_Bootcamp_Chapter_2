####    FIRST PART    ####

# Recap of last bootcamp theory: 
#       -print()
#       -additions, substractions, and multiplications using Python
#       -Strings, Integers, Floats, Booleans
#       -Input
#       -Conditionals



####    SECOND PART    ####

#   In the second part of the class, we'll practice some exercises we previously did in the last chapter
#   to refine our coding knowledge!


## 1. INPUT Exercises! ##

# Example 1: Welcome to the world of coding!
name = input("What is your name?: ")
print(name)
print("Welcome "+ name + " to the world of coding!")

# Example 2: Let's calculate something!
x = input("First number: ")
y = input("Second number: ")
product = int(x)*int(y)
print(product)

##  2. CONDITIONAL Exercise!  ##

# ONE Quiz #

# Print your question!
print('What company has built the first rocket to ever land back on Earth undamaged?')

# Define a variable for the player’s answer
answer = input('Your answer: ')

# Conditional IF
if answer == "spacex":
     print("\nThat is the correct answer! You win!")

# Conditional ELSE
else:
     print("\nYour answer is incorrect…You lose!")
