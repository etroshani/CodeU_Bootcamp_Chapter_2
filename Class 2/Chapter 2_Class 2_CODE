##     1) Introduction to Lists - Explain how to manipulate list and how it is useful     ##

# Printing out a list.
fruits = ["apple", "orange", "grape", "banana", "blueberry"]
print(fruits)

# Lists can contain different types of elements.
fruits = ["apple", 10, 5.4]
print(fruits)

# You can retrieve a specific element of a List using the INDEX number.
fruits = ["apple", "orange", "grape", "banana", "blueberry"]
print(fruits[0])

# A section of the list can be grabbed
print(fruits[0:2])

# Modifying an element in a list
print(fruits[1])
fruits[1] = "mandarine"
print(fruits[1])
print(fruits)

# Adding an element to the end of the list
fruits.append("watermelon")
print(fruits)

# A list can be empty. To add elements, we use append.
fruits = []
fruits.append("apple")
print(fruits)

# Adding an element at a specific position in the list
fruits = ["apple", "orange", "grape", "banana", "blueberry"]
fruits.insert(2, "watermelon")
print(fruits)

# Erasing an element in the list
fruits.remove("apple")
print(fruits)

# Detecting wether an element is in the list or not using Boolean
print("orange" in fruits)

# Finding the length of the list
print(len(fruits))


## Exercise: Create a To-Do list for your day! ##
todo = []

task1 = input("What task would you like to complete today: ")
todo.append(task1)

task2 = input("What 2nd task would you like to complete today: ")
todo.append(task2)

task3 = input("What 3rd task would you like to complete today: ")
todo.append(task3)

print("\nHere is your To-Do list for the day:\n1) " + todo[0] + "\n2) " + todo[1] + "\n3) " + todo[2])

# When you complete a task
complete = input("\nWhat task have you completed (1,2, or 3): ")

if complete == "1":
    todo.remove(task1)
elif complete == "2":
    todo.remove(task2)
elif complete == "3":
    todo.remove(task3)

print("\nHere are your remaining tasks for the day:\n1) " + todo[0] + "\n2) " + todo[1])




###     HOMEWORK   |    List Puzzle!     ###

# You must transform an Initial list into the Final list using the list manipulation methods you have learned in class!
#
#       Initial List: ["Nissan", "Toyota", "Mercedes", "Tesla", "Volvo", "Audi"]
#
#       Final List: ["Nissan", "Mercedes", "Porsche", "Dodge", "Tesla", "Audi", "Ferrari"]
#
#       RULES:
#       1) You can only use the methods learned in class.
#       2) It must be done in 5 manipulations.
#       3) Print the new list.


###     CODE     ###

initial_list = ["Nissan", "Toyota", "Mercedes", "Tesla", "Volvo", "Audi"]
