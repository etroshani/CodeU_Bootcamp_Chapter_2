####    FIRST PART    ####

# Recap of Class 2 theory: 
#       -Lists
#       -List Manipulations

###     HOMEWORK SOLUTION     ###

initial_list = ["Nissan", "Toyota", "Mercedes", "Tesla", "Volvo", "Audi"]

# Possible manipulations
initial_list.remove(initial_list[1])
initial_list.insert(2, "Porsche")
initial_list.insert(3, "Dodge")
initial_list.remove(initial_list[5])
initial_list.append("Ferrari")

print(initial_list)



####    SECOND PART    ####

##     1) Introduction to Loops: WHILE     ##

# Explain the functionality of LOOPS. How they work and when to use them.

# Example 1 
i = 0
while i<5:
    print(i)
    i = i + 1

# Example 2
i = 10
while i>1:
    print("Hello World")
    i = i - 1

# Example 3 - Can we go to the movies?
answer = input("Can we go to the movies? ")
while answer == "no":
    answer = input("Can we go to the movies? ")

print("Yay, thank you!")


##     2) Tiny Exercise - Let's build a list of numbers!      ##
list = []
number = 0
while number != 10:
    number = number + 1
    list.append(number)

print("This is the final list: " + list)


####    HOMEWORK: Create your Wish List Maker!    ####

#   You will build a Wish List Maker for anyone that would like to make a list of presents they would love to receive in the future!
#   1) You must create an empty list where each gift will be added
#   2) You will then define a variable using INPUT(). This is where the user is asked what present they would like to add to the list.
#   3) The list can contain only 5 items.
#   4) Create a WHILE Loop that ends once the list LENGTH is equal to 5. 
#   5) Print() the completed list to the user
